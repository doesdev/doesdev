## Hey, I'm Andrew
### I love music, code, and trying to find the right balance between pragmatism and creativity.

I am also the second best rapper in the world according to [this](https://www.hackreactor.com/blog/the-ultimate-songs-about-coding-playlist). Okay, well, maybe that's not quite what that says. I'll keep pretending it does though.

Mostly I exist here because the community is so generous with their creations. I hope that some things I create and share can help others the way other creators have helped me.
