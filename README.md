# Hey, I'm Andrew

## Senior software engineer focused on backend systems, APIs, and cloud infrastructure
Depth in JavaScript, PostgreSQL, and AWS, with experience building security-sensitive healthcare platforms.

Adaptive polyglot: comfortable in Ruby, C#, Swift, and Go and excited to use the most fitting tool for the job, new or known.

### I love music and code. As a developer, I seek to balance simplicity and practicality with creativity.

One time I made [JS source into a rap](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5dx4DgxslQ) (or vice versa). It even made it onto [this prestigious list](https://www.hackreactor.com/blog/the-ultimate-songs-about-coding-playlist). It’s not much, but it’s honest work.

Mostly I exist here because the community is so generous with their creations. I hope that some things I create and share can help others the way other creators have helped me.
