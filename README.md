# Hey, I'm Andrew
## Senior software engineer focused on backend systems, APIs, and cloud infrastructure.
## Depth in JavaScript, PostgreSQL, AWS, and security-sensitive healthcare platforms.
### I love music and code. As a developer, I seek to balance simplicity and practicality with creativity.

One time I made [JS source into a rap](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5dx4DgxslQ) (or vice versa). Even made it onto [this prestigious list](https://www.hackreactor.com/blog/the-ultimate-songs-about-coding-playlist). It's not much but it's honest work.

Mostly I exist here because the community is so generous with their creations. I hope that some things I create and share can help others the way other creators have helped me.
